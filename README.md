# EndHate

EndHate is an API that uses machine learning to decide whether text is hate speech or not. The model is built using the scikit-learn library and a
stochastic gradient descent classifier. The API is built on a Flask webserver that also hosts a demo page.

The model was trained on a dataset of labeled twitter posts. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset) is the link to the kaggle dataset.
